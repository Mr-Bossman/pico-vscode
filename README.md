# Raspberry Pi Pico Visual Studio Code extension

> NOTE: The extension is currently under development.

This is the official Visual Studio Code extension for Raspberry Pi Pico development. This extension equips you with a suite of tools designed to streamline your Pico projects using Visual Studio Code and the official [Pico SDK](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk).

For comprehensive setup instructions, refer to the [Getting Started guide](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf) PDF.

## Features

- Project Generator: Easily create new projects targeting the Ninja build system.
- Automatic CMake Configuration: Automatically configures CMake when loading a project.
- Version Switching: Seamlessly switch between different versions of the Pico SDK and tools.
- No Manual Setup Required: The extension handles environment variables, toolchain, SDK, and tool management for you.
- One-Click Compilation: Compile projects directly from the status bar with your selected SDK and tools.
- Offline Documentation: Access Pico SDK documentation offline.
- Quick Project Setup: Quickly create new Pico projects from the Explorer view when no workspace is open.

## Requirements by OS

> Supported Platforms: Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit), Windows x64, macOS (Sonoma and newer), Linux x64 and arm64

- Visual Studio Code v1.87.0 or later

### macOS
To meet the requirements for macOS, run the following command in Terminal to install necessary tools:
```zsh
xcode-select --install
```
This command installs all of the necessary tools, including but not limited to:
- Git 2.28 or later (ensure it's in your PATH)
- Tar (ensure it's in your PATH)
- Native C/C++ compiler (ensure it's in your PATH); supported compilers include `gcc` and `clang`

### Raspberry Pi OS
As of March 2024, all new Raspberry Pi OS images come with the necessary tools pre-installed. For older images, you can install the required tools by running: 

```bash
sudo apt install openocd ninja-build
```

### Linux
- Python 3.9 or later (ensure itâ€™s in your PATH or set in settings)
- Git 2.28 or later (ensure itâ€™s in your PATH)
- Tar (ensure itâ€™s in your PATH)
- Native C/C++ compiler (ensure itâ€™s in your PATH); supported compilers include `gcc` and `clang`
- \[Optional\] OpenOCD for debugging (Raspberry Pi OS only)
- \[Optional\] gdb-multiarch for debugging (x86_64 only)
- For \[Ubuntu 22.04\], install `libftdi1-2` and `libhidapi-hidraw0` packages to use OpenOCD

## Extension Settings

This extension provides the following settings:

* `raspberry-pi-pico.cmakePath`: Specify a custom path for CMake.
* `raspberry-pi-pico.python3Path`: Specify a custom path for Python 3.
* `raspberry-pi-pico.ninjaPath`: Specify a custom path for Ninja.
* `raspberry-pi-pico.gitPath`: Specify a custom path for Git.
* `raspberry-pi-pico.cmakeAutoConfigure`: Provide a GitHub personal access token (classic) with the `public_repo` scope. This token is used to check for available versions of the Pico SDK and other tools. Without it, the extension uses the unauthenticated GitHub API, which has a lower rate limit and may lead to restricted functionality if the limit is exceeded. The unauthenticated rate limit is per public IP address, so a token is more necessary if your IP is shared with many users.

## VS Code Profiles

If you work with multiple microcontroller toolchains, consider installing this extension into a [VS Code Profile](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/profiles) to avoid conflicts with other toolchains. Follow these steps:

1. Download the sample profile from [here](scripts/Pico.code-profile).
2. Open Command Palette with `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) and select `Profiles: Import Profile`.
3. Import the downloaded file to install the extension in a dedicated Pico profile.
4. This setup helps isolate the Pico extension from other extensions, reducing the risk of conflicts.

## Known Issues

- Custom Paths: Custom paths for Ninja, Python3, and Git are not stored in `CMakeLists.txt` like SDK and Toolchain paths. You need to build and configure projects through the extension to use these custom paths.

### GitHub API Rate Limit ("Error while retrieving SDK and toolchain versions")

If you encounter issues retrieving available Pico SDK versions, it may be due to GitHub API rate limits. To resolve this, create a personal access token (classic PAT) with the `public_repo` scope and set it in the global (User) extension settings to increase your rate limit.

## Build Instructions

For advanced users who want to build the extension `.vsix` file, follow these steps:

1. Install nodejs ([Instructions Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows))
2. Install Yarn globally: `npm install -g yarn`
3. Install VSCE globally: `npm install -g @vscode/vsce`
4. Run `yarn` in the project directory to install dependencies.
5. Build the extension with: `vsce package`.

This will generate a `.vsix` file, which you can install in VS Code using `code --install-extension path-to.vsix` or via the GUI: `Extensions > three dots > Install from VSIX`.
